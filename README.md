# Microservices-Project

Microservices are an architectural way of software development where the application is divided into small components (service). It allows the application to break into small parts which helps in solving debugging issues. Thus, it saves from crashing the entire system as you've to just focus on the small component.

This is the project that implements CRUD operations on MY SQL databse using Microservices Architecture.

As you can see, there are in total 6 individual spring boot applications configured to run on different ports. 4 amongst these (courseservice,facutlyservice,feeservice,studentservice) will create 4 tables respectively in MY SQL db when started.
